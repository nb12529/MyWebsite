    <h2> How is global warming affecting the animals</h2>
      <h3> But what animals 7 are affected the most </h3>
  
     <h2> <em>The Cheetah</em> </h2>
      <img src="https://freepngimg.com/thumb/cheetah/1-2-cheetah-png-image.png" height="" width="" alt=" The worlds fastest animal">
    <p> The number of cheetahs is rapidly declining due to climate change. Also, the numbers of cheetah's prey are dropping in certain areas.<br>
      Cheetahs must change their diets as a result, and they now attack other creatures who inhabit the sameÂ habitat. These animals often don't have the same calories as the usual prey of cheetahs.<br>
Also, as temperatures rise, cheetah reproduction is reduced, which has an effect on the large cat's ability to reproduce and get more young <br>
