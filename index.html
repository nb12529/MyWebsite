    <h2> How is global warming affecting the animals</h2>
      <h3> But what animals 7 are affected the most </h3>
  
     <h2> <em>The Cheetah</em> </h2>
      <img src="https://freepngimg.com/thumb/cheetah/1-2-cheetah-png-image.png" height="" width="" alt=" The worlds fastest animal">
    <p> Cheetah population numbers are declining dramatically in the face of climate change. And in some areas, cheetah's prey populations are declining, too.<br>
      As a result, cheetahs have had to change their diets and prey on other animals that live in the same environment. Often, these animals don’t have the same <br>
      nutritional value as cheetahs’ usual prey.<br>
And, rising temperatures also affect the big cat’s ability to reproduce by causing lowered reproduction of cheetahs. <br>
<br>
Because the number of cheetahs in the wild is declining steadily, conservationists are calling on the global community to lend support. One of the best<br> 
      ways to help is learning about cheetahs and adding to conservation efforts. For example, you can join  GVI volunteers and gather data and reserve on projects <br>
      that contribute towards cheetah conservation.<br></p>
