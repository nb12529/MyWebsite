    <h2> How is global warming affecting the animals</h2>
      <h3> But what animals 7 are affected the most </h3>
  
     <h2> <em>The Cheetah</em> </h2>
      <img src="https://freepngimg.com/thumb/cheetah/1-2-cheetah-png-image.png"alt=" The worlds fastest land animal" height="" width="" >
    <p> The number of cheetahs is rapidly declining due to climate change. Also, the numbers of cheetah's prey are dropping in certain areas. Cheetahs must change their diets as a result, and they now attack other creatures who inhabit the sameÂ habitat. These animals often don't have the same 
      calories as the usual prey of cheetahs. Also, as temperatures rise, cheetah reproduction is reduced, which has an effect on the large cat's ability to reproduce and get more young. The cheetah is the world's fastest land animal and Africa's most endangered big cat. Uniquely adapted for speed, the cheetah is capable of reaching 
      speeds greater than 110 kilometers per hour in just over three seconds. At top speed, their stride is seven meters long. Cheetah cubs have a dusty-gray coloring with long hair down their backs, which is called a mantle. Normally, they are about 12 inches long and weigh just 0.75 lbs at birth. After six weeks, the young cubs
      are strong enough to join the hunt and learn. At six months, they are able to practice killing live prey.

      <h2>Giant Pandas </h2>
<img src="https://pngimg.com/uploads/panda/panda_PNG1.png" alt= The giant big pandas are becoming extinct height="300" width="300"> 
      <p>There are now only 1,864 pandas in the wild, most of them in the Sichuan Province of China. According to the World Wildlife Fund, breeding efforts have been successful, and the once-endangered species was upgraded to "vulnerable" rank by the International Union for 
      Conservation of Nature in 2017. please help save the pandas to bring more pandas into the wild and bring the rank vulnerable up until they become common. You don't want these majestic animals extinct, do you The giant panda, a black-and-white bear, has a body typical of bears. It has black fur on its ears, eye patches, muzzle, legs, 
        and shoulders. The rest of the animal's coat is white. An adult female panda weighs 200 pounds. Pandas can climb as high as 13,000 feet and are also very good swimmers. Sometimes male pandas relax by doing handstands against trees. The giant panda and all pandas in common eat bamboo but the giant panda's diet is 99% bamboo this diet 
        is not bad in any way to the environment but climate change is really bad for the giant panda</p>

      <h2> Green Sea Turtles</h2>
      <img src="https://pngimg.com/uploads/turtle/turtle_PNG64.png" width="300" height="300" alt="The beauty in the sea will soon be gone">
    <p>Green sea turtles, like a lot of other animals, can't handle the heat from global warming. The temperature where their eggs are laid determines if there gonna be a boy or a girl. So with all this climate change messing up the temperatures, we have more female turtles hatching than males.
      That means there aren't as many male green turtles out there. And that's bad news for the future population of these turtles because fewer males mean fewer of them to mate with females. It's gonna be tougher for them to grow in numbers. If you want you can go to Seychelles and help by holding a part for helping green turtles.
      The green sea turtle is the largest hard-shelled sea turtle.  eating mostly seagrasses and algae they are unique among normal sea turtles in that they are herbivores. This diet is what gives their fat a greenish color (not their shells), which is where their name comes from. Green turtles are found throughout the whole entire world.
      Reptiles that are exceptionally well-suited to aquatic life are sea turtles. They can swim huge distances and dive to tremendous depths thanks to their large size, powerful front flippers, and hydrodynamic design. Their hind flippers are shorter than their front flippers, which are long, thin, and wing-like.

    <h2>Asian Elephants</h2>
    <img src="https://pngimg.com/uploads/elephants/elephants_PNG18751.png" alt="The lovely beautiful animal " width="300" height="300">
   <p> Elephants are really feeling the heat climate change has caused. They have to drink a lot of water to stay alive and all. But climate change and global warming are making it hard for them. It causes droughts and a shortage of water, making it harder for them to get their daily dose of water.
Not only that but when things get hotter, these invasive plants start taking over like crazy. And they outgrow what elephants usually eat - stuff like bamboo leaves and bananas. You can join GVI in Thailand if you wanna help protect Asian elephants by volunteering! The Asian elephant is the largest land mammal on the Asian continent. 
    They inhabit dry to wet forest and grassland habitats in 13 range countries spanning South and Southeast Asia. While they have preferred forage plants, Asian elephants have adapted to surviving on resources that vary based on the area. Elephants are highly intelligent creatures that 
exist together  with us on this planet. They possess complex consciousness and experience deep emotions. Throughout Africa, they have earned a great deal of admiration and respect from the local communities who share their habitat, as they hold an important cultural significance.
