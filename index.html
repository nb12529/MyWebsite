    <h2> How is global warming affecting the animals</h2>
      <h3> But what animals 7 are affected the most </h3>
  
     <h2> <em>The Cheetah</em> </h2>
      <img src="https://freepngimg.com/thumb/cheetah/1-2-cheetah-png-image.png"alt=" The worlds fastest land animal" height="" width="" >
    <p> The number of cheetahs is rapidly declining due to climate change. Also, the numbers of cheetah's prey are dropping in certain areas. Cheetahs must change their diets as a result, and they now attack other creatures who inhabit the sameÂ habitat. These animals often don't have the same <br>
      calories as the usual prey of cheetahs. Also,as temperatures rise, cheetah reproduction is reduced, which has an effect on the large cat's ability to reproduce and get more young <br>

      <h2>Giant Pandas </h2>
<img src="https://pngimg.com/uploads/panda/panda_PNG1.png" alt= The giant big pandas are becoming extinct height="300" width="300"> 
      <p>There are now only 1,864 pandas in the wild, most of them in the Sichuan Province of China. According to the World Wildlife Fund, breeding efforts have been successful, and the once-endangered species was upgraded to "vulnerable" rank by the International Union for <br>
      Conservation of Nature in 2017. please help save the pandas to bring more pandas into the wild and bring the rank vulnerable up until they become common. You don't want these majestic animals extinct, do you?<br></p>

      <h2> Green Sea Turtles</h2>
      <img src="https://pngimg.com/uploads/turtle/turtle_PNG64.png" width="300" height="300" alt="The beauty in the sea will soon be gone">
    <p>Green sea turtles, like a lot of other animals, can't handle the heat from global warming. The temperature where their eggs are laid determines if there gonna be a boy or a girl. So with all this climate change messing up the temperatures, we have more female turtles hatching than males.<br>
      That means there aren't as many male green turtles out there.And that's bad news for the future population of these turtles because fewer males mean fewer of them to mate with females. It's gonna be tougher for them to grow in numbers.<br>
 If you want you can go to Seychelles and help by holding a part for helping green turtles<br>
