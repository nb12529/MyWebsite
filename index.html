    <h2> How is global warming affecting the animals</h2>
      <h3> But what animals 7 are affected the most </h3>
  
     <h2> <em>The Cheetah</em> </h2>
      <img src="https://freepngimg.com/thumb/cheetah/1-2-cheetah-png-image.png"alt=" The worlds fastest land animal" height="" width="" >
    <p> The number of cheetahs is rapidly declining due to climate change. Also, the numbers of cheetah's prey are dropping in certain areas. Cheetahs must change their diets as a result, and they now attack other creatures who inhabit the sameÂ habitat. These animals often don't have the same 
      calories as the usual prey of cheetahs. Also, as temperatures rise, cheetah reproduction is reduced, which has an effect on the large cat's ability to reproduce and get more young

      <h2>Giant Pandas </h2>
<img src="https://pngimg.com/uploads/panda/panda_PNG1.png" alt= The giant big pandas are becoming extinct height="300" width="300"> 
      <p>There are now only 1,864 pandas in the wild, most of them in the Sichuan Province of China. According to the World Wildlife Fund, breeding efforts have been successful, and the once-endangered species was upgraded to "vulnerable" rank by the International Union for 
      Conservation of Nature in 2017. please help save the pandas to bring more pandas into the wild and bring the rank vulnerable up until they become common. You don't want these majestic animals extinct, do you?</p>

      <h2> Green Sea Turtles</h2>
      <img src="https://pngimg.com/uploads/turtle/turtle_PNG64.png" width="300" height="300" alt="The beauty in the sea will soon be gone">
    <p>Green sea turtles, like a lot of other animals, can't handle the heat from global warming. The temperature where their eggs are laid determines if there gonna be a boy or a girl. So with all this climate change messing up the temperatures, we have more female turtles hatching than males.
      That means there aren't as many male green turtles out there. And that's bad news for the future population of these turtles because fewer males mean fewer of them to mate with females. It's gonna be tougher for them to grow in numbers. If you want you can go to Seychelles and help by holding a part for helping green turtles.

    <h2>Asian Elephants</h2>
    <img src="https://pngimg.com/uploads/elephants/elephants_PNG18751.png" alt="The lovely beautiful animal " width="300" height="300">
    Elephants are really feeling the heat climate change has caused. They have to drink a lot of water to stay alive and all. But climate change and global warming are making it hard for them. It causes droughts and a shortage of water, making it harder for them to get their daily dose of water.
Not only that but when things get hotter, these invasive plants start taking over like crazy. And they outgrow what elephants usually eat - stuff like bamboo leaves and bananas. You can join GVI in Thailand if you wanna help protect Asian elephants by volunteering! The Asian elephant is the largest land mammal on the Asian continent. 
    They inhabit dry to wet forest and grassland habitats in 13 range countries spanning South and Southeast Asia. While they have preferred forage plants, Asian elephants have adapted to surviving on resources that vary based on the area.<br>
